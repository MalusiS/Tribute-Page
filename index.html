            "It took a man like Madiba to free not just the prisoner, but the jailer as well; to 
            show that you must trust others so that they may trust you; to teach that reconciliation 
            is not a matter of ignoring a cruel past, but a means of confronting it with inclusion 
            and generosity and truth.  He changed laws, but he also changed hearts."
